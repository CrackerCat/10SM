Native Windows 10 Start Menu/Fullscreen Start for Windows 11

*This is still experimental, and while I have gotten it to work on my system, I cannot guarantee this will work flawlessly on your system.

Manual Install Instructions

1. Backup and replace files with the ones in the "Files" directory. You will need to take ownership of these files, and also kill startmenuexperiencehost.exe and shellhost.exe to do this.
2. Install registry entry
3. Restart Explorer/sign out

Known issues:
- Start menu is slow to exit
- Tiles can only be pinned by drag and drop from start menu, or from pin to start outside the start menu
- Tiles can only be unpinned from outside the start menu, or by unpinning an entire group from inside the start menu
- old scripts no longer work, use them as a template if needed

Resolved Issues:
- pinning from outside start menu now works
- Tray icons should work now

Discoveries:
Windows 10 notification center/action center can be man restorable and mostly functional, but I am not currently working on it. Please comment if this interests you


the next thing I want to tackle is the slow exit, this wasn't a problem before Microsoft disabled the Windows 10 Start Menu in the earlier pre-release builds. 

cheers everyone!
