# 10SM
<b>Native Windows 10 Start Menu/Fullscreen Start for Windows 11</b>

Tested on build 22000.527 &amp; 22557 </br> </br>
<i>*ExplorerPatcher has implemented the Windows 10 start menu as a feature in a recent update. I encourage both users and non users of 10SM to check it out here: https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/</i>

<i>*While this works right now, it may or may not continue to work in future versions of Windows 11

*Installing the files required to restore the start menu requires manually replacing system files, please proceed with caution</i>





</br>
<b>Manual Install Instructions</b>

1. Backup and replace files with the ones in the "Files" directory. You will need to take ownership of these files, as well as kill startmenuexperiencehost.exe to do this.
2. Install registry entry
3. Restart Explorer/sign out

<i>*Be sure not to miss any files. The most common bugs when when failing to correctly replace all files are:</i>
 - Right click crashing the start menu
 - Start Menu not working at all
 - Tray icons not working
 
<b>Known issues:</b>
- Start menu is slow to exit



<b>Discoveries:</b>

- Windows 10 notification center/action center can be made restorable and mostly functional, but I am not currently working on it. It has the same slow exit as the start menu, so by fixing the start menu, it should fix this too. Please comment if this interests you!



cheers everyone!
